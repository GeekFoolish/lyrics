### Verse 1

I woke up this morning while Yawning <br>
I reached for my phone and my president is talking <br>
reckless on twitter <br>
It might seem crazy but I really think my own personal problems are bigger <br>
Now go figure <br>
see what would that entail? <br>
I need more intel before I show and tell <br>
I need y’all to feel the same pain that I felt <br>
I need y’all to understand why Kapernick knelt  <br>
well I understand people don't get it <br>
and I understand people don't care <br>
So I looked up fairness in the dictionary <br>
to my surprise the word wasn't there then I woke up <br>
rolled out of bed, still groggy from the pink pills <br>
Got some sunlight while sitting on the window sill  <br>
But honestly, I don’t got the will <br>
I’m kinda tired, and I just want to chill. <br>

### Chorus

I’m tired, I just want to chill today <br>
I said I’m tired. I just want to chill <br>
I said I’m tired, I just want to chill today <br>
I said I’m tired. I just want to chill <br>

### Verse 2

I woke up this evening with  <br>
no plans for the weekend <br>
no plans for live streaming <br>
it’s just how I’m feeling <br>
a lot of people fight that <br>
geek foolish never fight back <br>
mumble rap mumble rap <br>
geek foolish never writes that <br>
yea and that’s the difference between me and you <br>
between us and them <br>
between her and him <br>
yea, they call us freaks and we embrace it. Foolish Geeks. <br>
Hashtag it. Then search for it this week <br>
cause at the end of the day <br>
whether win or lose <br>
I’m just happy with the fact that I got to choose <br>
cause I can’t be me if I’m trying to be you <br>
and no one in this world can do what you do, so I <br>
rolled out of bed, still groggy from the pink pills <br>
saw a shooting star while sitting on the window sill  <br>
But honestly, I don’t got the will <br>
I’m kinda tired, and I just want to chill <br>

### Chorus

### Bridge

I know, I know, but I just don't know anymore
