# Middle of the Road

### Verse 1 
I’m acting all out of character <br>
I don’t know what it is <br>
I’m just trying to live my life right <br>
An inspiration for the kids <br>
But it’s kinda real hard tho <br>
And it’s fucking with my feelings <br>
Trying the impossible <br>
and they don’t want you to achieve it <br>
They say stay away from Geek Foolish <br>
They say he’s a bad influence <br>
Honestly i’m just trying my hardest <br>
I don’t know what I’m doing <br>
I’m just wearing my heart on my sleeve <br>
I’m just doing what I know best <br>
Even though it’s not hard for you <br>
Every day I'm still feeling stressed <br>

###  Chorus
How could I go down the middle of the road when the middle of the road goes over <br>
How could I go down the middle of the road when the middle of that road goes over <br>
How could go I go down the middle of the road <br>
How could go I go down the middle of the road <br>
How could I go down the middle of the road when the middle of that road goes over <br>

### Verse 2
I have a lot of anxiety <br>
I ain’t afraid to admit it <br>
Go ahead and show your true colors <br>
they probably still won’t get it <br>
And it’s fine if they don’t understandi <br>
just always be yourself <br>
Cause you can’t be the best you <br>
If you’re being someone else <br>
and they’ll try to take your steering wheel <br>
even though you’re supposed to drive <br>
back seaters directing from the passenger side <br>
but this is your ride <br>
and they can’t see far over your shoulders <br>
they try to drive straight <br>
but you know the middle that road goes over <br>
