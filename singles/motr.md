# Middle of the Road

### Verse 1 
I’m acting all out of character
I don’t know what it is
I’m just trying to live my life right
An inspiration for the kids
But it’s kinda real hard tho
And it’s fucking with my feelings
Trying the impossible
and they don’t want you to achieve it
They say stay away from Geek Foolish
They say he’s a bad influence
Honestly i’m just trying my hardest
I don’t know what I’m doing
I’m just wearing my heart on my sleeve
I’m just doing what I know best
Even though it’s not hard for you
Every day I'm still feeling stressed

###  Chorus
How could I go down the middle of the road when the middle of the road goes over

### Verse 2
I have a lot of anxiety 
I ain’t afraid to admit it
Go ahead and show your true colors
they probably still won’t get it 
And it’s fine if they don’t understand
just always be yourself
Cause you can’t be the best you
If you’re being someone else 
and they’ll try to take your steering wheel
even though you’re supposed to drive
back seaters directing from the passenger side
but this is your ride
and they can’t see far over your shoulders 
they try to drive straight
but you know the middle that road goes over
