Verse 1
I woke up this morning while Yawning
I reached for my phone and my president is talking
reckless on twitter
It might seem crazy but I really think my own personal problems are bigger
Now go figure
see what would that entail?
I need more intel before I show and tell
I need y’all to feel the same pain that I felt
I need y’all to understand why Kapernick knelt
well I understand people don't get it
and I understand people don't care
So I looked up fairness in the dictionary
to my surprise the word wasn't there then I woke up
rolled out of bed, still groggy from the pink pills
Got some sunlight while sitting on the window sill
But honestly, I don’t got the will
I’m kinda tired, and I just want to chill.

Chorus
I’m tired, I just want to chill today
I said I’m tired. I just want to chill
I said I’m tired, I just want to chill today
I said I’m tired. I just want to chill

Verse 2
I woke up this evening with
no plans for the weekend
no plans for live streaming
it’s just how I’m feeling
a lot of people fight that
geek foolish never fight back
mumble rap mumble rap
geek foolish never writes that
yea and that’s the difference between me and you
between us and them
between her and him
yea, they call us freaks and we embrace it. Foolish Geeks.
Hashtag it. Then search for it this week
cause at the end of the day
whether win or lose
I’m just happy with the fact that I got to choose
cause I can’t be me if I’m trying to be you
and no one in this world can do what you do, so I
rolled out of bed, still groggy from the pink pills
saw a shooting star while sitting on the window sill
But honestly, I don’t got the will
I’m kinda tired, and I just want to chill

Chorus
Bridge
I know, I know, but I just don't know anymore
